# Unity-Brick-Breaker
A simple brick breaker game made in unity

The game goes on until the player loses all balls on the screen.

Each time the player clears the bricks on screen, a new set of randomly generated brickss is generated, and the player is granted 1 additional ball.

This project was made in 2 days as an interview task, so it might have some bugs i didn't have time to find and fix.
